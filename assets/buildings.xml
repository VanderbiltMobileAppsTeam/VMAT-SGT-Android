        <FACILITY_REMARKS>University School of Nashville is an independent K-12 school that seeks to model the best educational practices in a culturally diverse environment. USN began life as the Winthrop Model School, founded in 1892 by the Peabody Board of Trustees for the demonstration of proper teaching methods. In 1915, the school became Peabody Demonstration School, located in the basement of Jesup Psychological Building on Peabody&#39;s 21st Ave. campus. In 1925, the present building was completed on Edgehill Ave., designed in the classical style. When Peabody College closed the demonstration school in 1974, a group of parents, alumni, students and teachers formed University School of Nashville as an independent institution. Additions that have been made to the original building include a new west wing completed in 1985, the Sperling Center in 1989, the Gordon Wing in 1997, and the Tibbott Center for Visual Arts in 2003. The school is a popular choice for children of Vanderbilt staff.</FACILITY_REMARKS>

Before steam heat was installed in 1899, corner fireplaces heated the rooms. Coal bins were in the basement, and the students bought their own coal. Each cottage was designed with four double rooms on each floor, each room with an outside entrance, and no interior doors connecting the rooms. There were originally six cottages: Alpha, Belleview, Cumberland, Delphi, Euclid and Franklin. Alpha was removed in 1966 to make way for Carmichael Towers East. Belleview now houses NPHC Sororities; Cumberland is the home of Delta Gamma; Delphi houses NPHC Fraternities; Euclid is now K. C.

Neely Auditorium is now the home of the Vanderbilt University Theatre. The building&#39;s collegiate Gothic brick and stone exterior gives no hint of the intimate performance space that has been created inside. In 1976, the hall was transformed from an auditorium into a multi-form theater with flexible light and sound capabilities and full production and backstage facilities. Movable seating can be arranged to suit each production, so that any part of the space can serve as stage or auditorium.</FACILITY_REMARKS>

        <FACILITY_URL>IMAGES/11.JPG</FACILITY_URL>
        <FACILITY_REMARKS>When Vanderbilt first opened its doors for classes in October 1875, this Victorian building with sweeping stairways, twin towers, a gabled roof and ornate arches was known as Main Building. Old Main housed classrooms, laboratories, administrative offices for all departments except law (which had rooms downtown) and medical (a separate entity on the University of Nashville campus several miles away), and the library. A 1,000-pound Westminster bell hung in one of the towers until a devastating fire in 1905 destroyed most of the building. After the fire, Main Building was rebuilt as &quot;College Hall,&quot; in an Italian style inspired by the town hall in Siena, Italy, with a castellated roof line instead of gables, and a single tower. Nashville schoolchildren raised money to buy a 2,000-lb. bronze bell for the rebuilt structure.  In 1939, College Hall was renamed in memory of James H. Kirkland, Vanderbilt&#39;s second chancellor, who led the university through 44 formative years. Kirkland Hall underwent exterior and interior renovation in the 1980s and now houses the offices of the chancellor and general officers, deans of the College of Arts and Science and Graduate School, and other administrators.</FACILITY_REMARKS>

(Old Kissam was razed in 1958, a year after this replacement quadrangle was completed.) Individual buildings are named for faculty members and trustees who were memorable in the university&#39;s history.</FACILITY_REMARKS>

        <FACILITY_REMARKS>Barnard Hall and Vanderbilt Hall, duplex dormitories, built in 1952, were the last campus buildings of collegiate Gothic design built. Like most of Vanderbilt&#39;s older dormitories, both have been completely renovated. They now have an apartment for a faculty member, who lives among the students for the academic year; seminar, study, and music practice rooms; lounges and TV areas; and cable connections for computers in every student room. Barnard Hall is named for the legendary Edward E. Barnard, a Vanderbilt astronomer in the 1880s, who was known in his time as the ranking authority on the Milky Way. Frederick Vanderbilt Hall is named for the Commodore&#39;s grandson, who left a large part of his estate to the university.</FACILITY_REMARKS>

The names of the 44 who gave their lives are carved on mantels in the Memorial Room. This was the first building of collegiate Gothic design on the campus and the first of eight major buildings designed for Vanderbilt by architect Henry C. Hibbs. Built with funds raised by popular subscription, and at a cost of less than $250,000, Alumni Hall was the hub of student activity until that role was assumed by Rand Hall, and later by Sarratt Student Center. Now Alumni Hall is home to various university offices.</FACILITY_REMARKS>

        <FACILITY_REMARKS>Victorian style Benson Science Hall, standing in a grove of Vanderbilt&#39;s oldest and most majestic trees, is a composite of two historic structures, Science Hall (1880) and adjacent Old Central (abt. 1859). The trees were small and young when Science Hall was built in 1880. Machine and forge shops and steam boilers for the new campus heating plant were in the basement, classrooms and laboratories for Botany, Geology, and Engineering on upper floors. Over the years, Old Science provided classrooms and offices for English, Philosophy, and Mathematics; housed the Geology Museum; and in the 1970s was a studio art center. Old Central, once the home of Mr. and Mrs. Henry S. Foote, is the only campus building that antedates the university. Bishop Holland Mctyeire lived here while overseeing construction of the first campus buildings. It was a faculty residence for many years, then housed women students. The departments of Philosophy and Mathematics were here; English and Economic Development were later residents. Old Science and Old Central have survived more than one master plan for the campus that called for their removal. In 1983, the two buildings were connected and restored with funds from Robert G. Benson and the Benson family, creating a single unit that today houses the English and History departments.</FACILITY_REMARKS>

Robert Harmon&#39;s &quot;Word of God&quot; window is over the doors. The quadrangle was built in 1959 and later named to commemorate the 1966 merger of Oberlin College Graduate School of Theology with Vanderbilt Divinity School. Benton Chapel is named for John Keith Benton, dean of the Divinity School from 1939 to 1956. Harvie Branscomb, chancellor from 1946 to 1963, and his wife, Margaret, are interred in the west wall. Directly beneath Benton Chapel is All Faith Chapel, a small space used for meditation, weddings, services, and other events.</FACILITY_REMARKS>

In addition to serving as a venue for classroom teaching and a home for interdisciplinary program offices, Buttrick Hall is equipped to support public lectures, academic conferences and the needs of Vanderbilt&#39;s transinstitutional centers. The name Buttrick Hall recognizes Wallace Buttrick (1853-1926), Vanderbilt&#39;s principal advocate at the Rockefeller-funded General Education Board where he served as secretary (1902-1917), president (1917-1923), and chairman (1923-1926). GEB&#39;s support of academic and medical development at Vanderbilt was inestimable. Buttrick Hall was one of three collegiate Gothic classroom buildings for which GEB gave half the original construction funds.</FACILITY_REMARKS>

        <FACILITY_REMARKS>The white-domed Faye and Joe Wyatt center for Education with its 10 Corinthian columns dominates the Peabody College campus. The Wyatt Center is one of the nation&#39;s most advanced learning environments, with state-of-the-art technologies such as enhanced computer classrooms, video conferencing and multimedia seminar rooms, satellite downlink and broadcast capabilities, and video-editing suites. Philanthropist John D. Rockefeller gave this landmark building to then-new Peabody College in 1915 as a personal gift. Under the leadership of chancellor Joe B. Wyatt, who served as chancellor from 1982 to 2000, Peabody&#39;s campus underwent a transformation, including renovation and expansion of this signature building. In 2000, the building which had been known as the Social Religious Building was renamed for outgoing chancellor Wyatt and his wife, Faye. Wyatt Center is home to the Department of Teaching and Learning, Vanderbilt Programs for Talented Youth and various centers as well as VUStar, the Vanderbilt on-campus broadcast facility.</FACILITY_REMARKS>

        <FACILITY_URL>IMAGES/5.JPG</FACILITY_URL>
        <FACILITY_REMARKS>Barnard Hall and Vanderbilt Hall are duplex dormitories, built in 1952. They were the last campus buildings of collegiate Gothic design built on campus. Like most of Vanderbilt&#39;s older dormitories, both have been completely renovated. They now have an apartment for a faculty member, who lives among the students for the academic year; seminar, study, and music practice rooms; lounges and TV areas; and cable connections for computers in every student room. Barnard Hall is named for the legendary Edward E. Barnard, a Vanderbilt astronomer in the 1880s, who was known in his time as the ranking authority on the Milky Way. Frederick Vanderbilt Hall is named for the Commodore&#39;s grandson, who left a large part of his estate to the university.</FACILITY_REMARKS>

        <FACILITY_REMARKS>The Fine Arts Gallery, also known as the Old Gym, a gem of Victorian architecture that is one of Vanderbilt&#39;s most notable landmarks, was built in 1880, seven years after the university&#39;s founding, in response to student demand for physical training. A large annex was added in 1920, and the Old Gym was host to basketball games, team practice and student dances until Memorial Gymnasium opened in 1952. The annex was removed in 1965. In 1970, the structure was recorded in graphic detail by the historic American buildings survey and subsequently placed on the national register of historic places. The Old Gym is now home to the Fine Arts Gallery and the Department of History of Art.</FACILITY_REMARKS>

Payne&#39;s vision for Peabody&#39;s future was a major influence in the development of the school&#39;s faculty, curriculum and physical plant, and Payne deserves much of the credit for the beauty of Peabody&#39;s campus. The Payne Building, which contains classrooms and offices, was constructed and named in his memory in 1953. A small statue from the tomb site of an ancient Korean king stands outside the Payne building. It was a gift from the South Korean government in appreciation for the work of a Peabody faculty delegation that helped rebuild the South Korean educational system after the Korean War.</FACILITY_REMARKS>

Its name honors Francis Furman, a Nashville merchant, whose widow provided the building funds. Furman&#39;s grey stone composition stands in sharp contrast to adjacent brick buildings - the collegiate Gothic Calhoun and Garland Halls built in the late 1920s and the contemporary-style Law School building. Originally the home of science and engineering departments, in 1967, Furman was remodeled to house the humanities. Today, Furman Hall houses foreign languages, classical studies, philosophy and the Women&#39;s Studies program.</FACILITY_REMARKS>

        <FACILITY_REMARKS>Jean and Alexander Heard Library was built in 1941 to house the joint University Libraries, a cooperative venture of Vanderbilt University, Peabody College and Scarritt College. This collegiate Gothic building, designed by architect Henry Hibbs, was the first centrally air-conditioned building on campus. The General Education Board and Carnegie Corporation gave financial assistance to the original building project, as did more than 5,000 alumni and other friends. The H. Fort Flowers graduate wing, added in 1969, is of modern design, a complete departure from the collegiate style of the original building. The  building and all other campus libraries became units of Vanderbilt University Library after Peabody College merged with Vanderbilt in 1979. in 1983, Vanderbilt&#39;s library, with its several units, was named in honor of Alexander Heard, chancellor of the university from 1963 to 1982, and his wife, Jean Keller Heard.</FACILITY_REMARKS>

It was considered to be a model of excellence in medical education facilities. The foundations were designed to carry additional floors. The Rockefeller and Carnegie foundations gave major financial support. Most of the building&#39;s collegiate Gothic design is now hidden behind additions made over the years. The only original entrances still visible are the north court entrance leading to learned labs and the west entrance near the Zerfoss Student Health Center. The 21-bed General Clinical Research Center, an inpatient orthopaedic unit, a Level 1 burn center, a sub-acute care unit, administrative support services for the hospital and Medical Center, faculty and administrative offices, and research space for Medical School departments are housed in Medical Center North.</FACILITY_REMARKS>
